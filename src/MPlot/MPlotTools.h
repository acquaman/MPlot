		<b>Basic equations: zooming in while maintaining a datapoint under the mouse cursor </b>

		-\c x: x datapoint value
		-\c min: previous axis minimum
		-\c max: previous axis maximum
		-\c min': new axis minimum
		-\c max': new axis maximum
		-\c F: zoom scale factor (ex: 0.6)

		1) The new scale is smaller than previous one; ie: multiplied by factor F

		\f[
				(max' - min') = F (max - min)
		\f]

		2) Also distance from \c x to \c min, as fraction of total axis range, stays constant

		\f[
				(x-min)/(max-min) = (x-min')/(max'-min')
		\f]

		Combining [1] and [2], and algebra:

		\f[
				min' = x + F(min - x)
		\f]
